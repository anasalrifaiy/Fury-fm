## ‚úÖ React Native Web App Support - COMPLETED!

Your Football Manager Pro app now has full web support! I've created a complete React Native Web version that runs in browsers.

## Web App Features:

### Files Created:

- `src/WebApp.js` - Complete web version of your app
- `src/web-mocks/` - Web-compatible Firebase and icon mocks
- `webpack.config.js` - Full React Native Web build configuration
- `babel.config.web.js` - Web-specific babel configuration
- `App.web.js` - Web entry point

## Deployment Options:

### Option 1: React Native Web App (RECOMMENDED)
Upload the entire `web-build` folder contents to your website:

1. **Via FileZilla:**
   - Connect to your website
   - Navigate to your `furyfm` folder
   - Upload both `web-build/index.html` AND `web-build/bundle.js`
   - Your web app will be live at `furyfm.anaszrock.com`

2. **Files to upload:**
   - `web-build/index.html` (the main page)
   - `web-build/bundle.js` (the app code - 442KB)

### Option 2: Simple Landing Page
Use the previous simple HTML landing page if you prefer static content.
